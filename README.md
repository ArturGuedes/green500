## Getting Started

You can use this extension in **launch** or **attach** mode.

In **launch** mode it will start an instance of Firefox navigated to the start page of your application
and terminate it when you stop debugging. You can also set the `reAttach` option in your launch configuration to `true`, in this case Firefox won't be terminated at the end of your debugging session and the debugger will re-attach to it when
you start the next debugging session - this is a lot faster than restarting Firefox every time. `reAttach` also works for WebExtension debugging: in this case, the WebExtension is (re-)installed as a [temporary add-on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox).
